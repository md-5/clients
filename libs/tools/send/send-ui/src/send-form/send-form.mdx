# Send Form

The send form is a re-usable form component that can be used to create, update, and clone sends. It
is configured via a `SendFormConfig` object that is passed to the component as a prop. The
`SendFormConfig` object can be created manually, or a `SendFormConfigService` can be used to create
it. A default implementation of the `SendFormConfigService` exists in the `@bitwarden/send-ui`
library.
